  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Non-collisional current sheets that form during magnetic reconnection can become unstable to the formation of plasmoids, enabling high reconnection rates. This work investigates the instability conditions for plasmoid development in purely collisionless current sheets with a strong guide field.</p>

  <h2>Work Explanation</h2>
  <p>The study analyzes the geometry of the reconnecting current sheet and its elongation. It identifies the regimes in which the sheet becomes plasmoid unstable. The research demonstrates that plasmoids can form in collisionless contexts with a much smaller aspect ratio than in the collisional regime.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The study reveals that the formation of plasmoids in collisionless current sheets can occur at an aspect ratio threshold of ≤ 10, an order of magnitude smaller than in resistive magnetohydrodynamics. The reconnection rate associated with the marginally stable current sheets is approximately 0.1 times the product of the Alfvèn speed and the reconnecting magnetic field upstream, explaining fast reconnection in large-scale collisionless systems.</p>
