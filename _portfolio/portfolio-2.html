   <p>Figure &#92;(\ref{fig:vorticity}&#92;) shows the vorticity of the gyrocenters, corresponding to &#36;&#92;lapp ( &#92;phi - &#92;rho_s^2 B_&#92;parallel)&#36;. We observe a significant local rotational motion of the plasma, indicated by the presence of important vorticity. As the fluid is twisting, magnetic eddies are formed due to magnetic reconnection at the separatrices.</p>
