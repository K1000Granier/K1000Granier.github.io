I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Centre for mathematical Plasma Astrophysics (CmPA) of KU Leuven. 
<!--Prior to this position, I worked as a postdoctoral research assistant in the <a href="https://fluid.oca.eu/fr/fluid">Fluid and Plasma Research Group</a> at <a href="https://lagrange.oca.eu/fr/accueil-lagrange">Laboratoire Lagrange, under the joint supervision of Emanuele Tassi and <a href="https://www.oca.eu/fr/thierry-passot">Thierry Passot</a>. -->

My research focuses on plasma astrophysics. Much of my work involves analytic calculations and massively parallel numerical simulations. 

<!--My research work is concerned with the universal process of magnetic reconnection. This process is a complex mutli-scale phenomenon responsible for triggering powerful releases of magnetic energy in astrophysical plasmas, such as solar flares. More recently, the investigation of instabilities in reconnecting current sheets and the subsequent formation of secondary magnetic islands, known as plasmoids, has significantly contributed to our understanding of magnetic reconnection.-->

Some of my research interests are listed below:

- Magnetic reconnection & plasmoid instability (relativistic and non-relativistic)
- Turbulence (space physics and solar wind)
- Plasma instabilities
- Fluid modelling

* Jan. 2024: I moved to KU Leuven to work in Prof. Fabio Bacchini's group. 

* [Transalpine Workshop: magnetic reconnection and turbulence in space and fusion plasmas](https://www.oca.eu/en/workshop) 15 and 16 May 2024, Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, Nice, France. 

* Talk: [JPP Frontiers of Plasma Physics Colloquium](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-plasma-physics/jpp-frontiers-of-plasma-physics-colloquium) on Thursday 20th July 2023.

<!--During my PhD, I focused on addressing various aspects of collisionless reconnection in two-dimensional systems. Specifically, I conducted simulations and mathematical modeling to explore the fundamental physics of this process. Additionally, I investigated the impact of an anisotropic equilibrium temperature distribution and a finite βe parameter on magnetic reconnection and the formation of plasmoids.-->
