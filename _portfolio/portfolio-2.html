The development of the tearing mode is so rapid that the outflow directed towards the interior of the island seems to generate a mushroom-shaped structure, symptomatic of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability.
After that, turbulence triggered by the Kelvin-Helmotz instability spreads extensively beyond the separatrix of the primary island. <br/>

 A velocity shear along the magnetic field line triggers the fluid instability. The magnetic field lines become distorted and stretched in the direction of the shear.  At a latter time, as the fluid is twisting, small magnetic eddies are formed due to magnetic reconnection at the separatrices.
