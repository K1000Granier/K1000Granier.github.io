<p>Here's a 2D simulation, composed of 3600^2 points, illustrating turbulence decaying at a sub-ion scale. This simulation employs a two-field Hamiltonian gyrofluid model, incorporating finite ion Larmor radius corrections, parallel magnetic field fluctuations, and electron inertia (see the model from Granier et al. 2024 or Passot et al. 2024).</p>

<p>This model effectively captures the dynamics of Alfvén and kinetic Alfvén waves, making it ideal for studying inertial collisionless reconnection. The observed turbulence occurs at the sub-ion range and scales smaller than the electron skin depth.</p>

<p>It makes is particularly efficient for examining how the nature of turbulence depends on the ion plasma β, whether it's dominated by reconnection events or exhibits hydrodynamic behavior.</p>
