I am currently working as a research assistant at Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik. 
<!--Prior to this position, I worked as a postdoctoral research assistant in the <a href="https://fluid.oca.eu/fr/fluid">Fluid and Plasma Research Group</a> at <a href="https://lagrange.oca.eu/fr/accueil-lagrange">Laboratoire Lagrange, under the joint supervision of Emanuele Tassi and <a href="https://www.oca.eu/fr/thierry-passot">Thierry Passot</a>. -->

My research focuses on plasma astrophysics. Much of my work involves analytic calculations and massively parallel numerical simulations. 

<!--My research work is concerned with the universal process of magnetic reconnection. This process is a complex mutli-scale phenomenon responsible for triggering powerful releases of magnetic energy in astrophysical plasmas, such as solar flares. More recently, the investigation of instabilities in reconnecting current sheets and the subsequent formation of secondary magnetic islands, known as plasmoids, has significantly contributed to our understanding of magnetic reconnection.-->

Some of my research interests are listed below:

- Magnetic reconnection & plasmoid instabity (relativistic and non-relativistic)
- Turbulence (space physics and solar wind)
- Plasma instabilities
- Fluid modelling 



<!--During my PhD, I focused on addressing various aspects of collisionless reconnection in two-dimensional systems. Specifically, I conducted simulations and mathematical modeling to explore the fundamental physics of this process. Additionally, I investigated the impact of an anisotropic equilibrium temperature distribution and a finite βe parameter on magnetic reconnection and the formation of plasmoids.-->
