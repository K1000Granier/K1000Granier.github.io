In this work, we performed 3D3V hybrid-Vlasov (fully kinetic ions and fluid electrons) simulations of sub-ion-scale plasma turbulence with quasi-isotropic, compressible injection close to the ion scales. 
The goal was to reproduce the typical conditions past the Earth’s bow shock, in the magnetosheath, to investigate electron-only reconnection and ion heating.

We examined how the occurrence of electron-only reconnection can be triggered in kinetic-range turbulence. This unique form of reconnection is characterized by an outflow predominantly carried by electrons alone and has been recently observed in various regions in the near-Earth’s environment suach as the magnetosheath.

Secondly, we explored how turbulence conditions that favour the emergence of electron-only reconnection impact the turbulent heating of ions.
