  <p>Non-collisional current sheets that form during magnetic reconnection can become unstable to the formation of plasmoids, enabling high reconnection rates. </p>

  <p>In Granier et al. 2022, we investigate the instability conditions for plasmoid development in purely collisionless current sheets with a strong guide field and low plasma beta.
  The study was conducted using 2D simulations performed with the fluid solver SCOP3D, with a resolution of up to 2400x2400 points.<p>
  <p>The study reveals that the formation of plasmoids in collisionless current sheets can occur at an aspect ratio threshold of â‰¤ 10.</p>
