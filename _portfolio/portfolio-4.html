In this work, we performed 3D3V hybrid-Vlasov (fully kinetic ions and fluid electrons) simulations of sub-ion-scale plasma turbulence with quasi-isotropic, compressible injection close to the ion scales. 
The goal of this study was to reproduce the typical conditions past the Earth’s bow shock, in the magnetosheath, to investigate electron-only reconnection and ion heating.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Electron-only reconnection event. The white and blue arrows are magnetic field lines (lower magnitude in blue, larger magnitude in white). The yellow and red arrows are streamlines of the velocity (normalized by the Alfvén speed) field, for the electron (left panel) and the ions (right panel). The arrow size for the ions velocity has been multiplied by 2.</figcaption>
