I am currently working as a postdoctoral research assistant under the joint supervision of <a href="/fr/thierry-passot">Thierry Passot</a> and Emanuele Tassi in the <a href="https://fluid.oca.eu/fr/fluid">Fluid and Plasma Research Group</a> at <a href="https://lagrange.oca.eu/fr/accueil-lagrange">Laboratoire Lagrange.

My research work is concerned with the universal process of magnetic reconnection. This process is a complex mutli-scale phenomenon responsible for triggering powerful releases of magnetic energy in astrophysical plasmas, such as solar flares. More recently, the investigation of instabilities in reconnecting current sheets and the subsequent formation of secondary magnetic islands, known as plasmoids, has significantly contributed to our understanding of magnetic reconnection.

During my PhD, I focused on addressing various aspects of collisionless reconnection in two-dimensional systems. Specifically, I conducted simulations and mathematical modeling to explore the fundamental physics of this process. Additionally, I investigated the impact of an anisotropic equilibrium temperature distribution and a finite Î²e parameter on magnetic reconnection and the formation of plasmoids.
