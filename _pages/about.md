My research work is concerned with the universal process of magnetic reconnection. Magnetic reconnection is a complex mutli-scale phenomenon leading to a change of topology of the magnetic field and responsible for powering some of the most explosive release of magnetic energy in astrophysical plasmas, such as solar flares. In particular, instabilities of reconnecting current sheets leading to the formation of secondary magnetic islands, called plasmoids, have more recently played an important role in advancing the understanding of magnetic reconnection.
My PhD thesis addresses some questions concerning collisionless reconnection in 2D systems. The main focus is on the simulations and mathematical modelling of the fundamental physics of the process, as well as on the investigation of the influence of an anisotropic equilibrium temperature distribution and that of a finite Î²e parameter on magnetic reconnection and the formation of plasmoids.
